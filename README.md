# NT213.O22.ATCL - Web Security and Applications  
### Project Acunetix - Web Security Testing  

## 📌 Description  
This is the course project for **"Web Security and Applications - NT213.O22.ATCL"**, where we build vulnerable web applications and use **Acunetix** to scan for security flaws.  

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Develop web applications containing common security vulnerabilities.  
- Use **Acunetix** to scan and analyze vulnerabilities.  
- Assess the severity and exploitation methods of each vulnerability.  

## 🔍 Implemented Vulnerabilities  
The project includes web applications with the following security flaws:  

1. **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)**  
   - Simulating CSRF attacks on web forms to exploit unauthorized actions.  

2. **File Upload Vulnerability**  
   - Allowing unauthorized file uploads, leading to potential code execution.  

3. **SQL Injection**  
   - Exploiting user inputs to execute unauthorized SQL queries.  

4. **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)**  
   - Injecting malicious JavaScript into web pages to steal data or hijack user sessions.  

## 🛠 Tools Used  
- **Acunetix v8.0** - Automated web vulnerability scanning tool.  
- **Docker** - Used for setting up a secure testing environment.  
- **Python/PHP/SQL** - Programming languages for building vulnerable applications.  

## 🚀 How to Run the Project  
1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/NT213.O22.ATCL.git
   cd NT213.O22.ATCL
   ```
2. **Deploy the vulnerable applications using Docker or a local server.**
3. **Configure Acunetix to scan each application.**
4. **Analyze results and document detected vulnerabilities.**
5. 
## 📄 Report
**All Acunetix scan results, vulnerability analysis, and remediation recommendations are compiled in Report.pdf.**
